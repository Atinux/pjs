# Examples

To run and edit the examples we are going to see, you can clone the repository on your computer:

```
git clone https://github.com/Atinux/pjs.git
```

Then you can launch the `pjs` command in the `examples/` directory:

```
cd pjs/examples/
pjs
```

If you go on http://localhost:8080, you can see all the example we are going to see in this chapter.
